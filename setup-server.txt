To set up a newdjangosite server from a fresh Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS installation:

1. Run 'sudo apt-get update'
2. Run 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
3. Install the OpenSSH server using 'sudo apt-get install openssh-server'
4. Run 'ssh-keygen -C _email_' and register ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub with GitHub. An empty passphrase is less secure, but makes deployments faster.
5. In the /web directory in a local dev environment, run 'fab setup_server' or 'fab setup_server:setup_wins=True' depending on whether WINS name resolution is needed. When in doubt, omit setup_wins.
6. When prompted for a host string, enter one in the form of '_user_@_host_'
7. When prompted to "enter password for new role", enter a password to remotely access PostgreSQL

To set up a new deployment on a properly configured (see above) newdjangosite server:
1. Consider updating the username and password found in /web/newdjangosite/settings__deployment_.py and committing/pushing it. Note that the Fabric script won't work with passwords containing shell escape characters.
2. In the /web directory in a local dev environment, run 'fab setup_deployment:_deployment_,"_git@github.com:user/repo.git_"'
3. When prompted for a host string, enter one in the form of '_user_@_host_'
4. When prompted for a primary email and subsequent fields, enter the information for the Django superuser to create
5. To deploy changes in the future, after committing/pushing run 'fab deploy:_deployment_'
6. If this is the first deployment on a server, consider updating the global configurations for the server. To do so:
    1. Update the files in /config/ubuntu-12.04/global. Look for the 'newdjangosite' prompts for commonly changed values
    2. After updating, commit/push your changes and run fab deploy
    3. Run 'fab deploy_global_config:_deployment_'
    4. If PostgreSQL does not start after the update, a reboot may be needed
